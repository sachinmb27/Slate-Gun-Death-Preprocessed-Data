# Slate-Gun-Death-Preprocessed-Data

Slate Magazine collected the gun death victims between December 2012 and December 2013 and formed up a dataset. Here, this dataset is used to build a visualization of the gun victims. For that, first the data needs to be cleaned and preprocessed accordingly. 

A python script to [preprocess](https://github.com/sachinmb27/Slate-Gun-Death-Preprocessed-Data/blob/master/preprocess.py) the dataset into victims based on the states/cities.

To run this file, use the command
`python preprocess.py`

Running the above script, will produce 4 JSON files containing the counts of state victims, city victims and victim list.
